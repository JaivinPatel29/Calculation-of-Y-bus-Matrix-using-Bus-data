# Calculation-of-Y-bus-Matrix-using-Bus-data
In this project, bus admittance matrix (Y-Bus matrix) of size [Number of Buses*Number of Buses] for any number of buses and line is computed using MATLAB.
The following transmission line data is used to compute the y_bus matrix : 
Bus number, capacitive admittance shunt, impedance (series)(r+jx).
It is recommended to download all the files in the same folder as "main_y_bus.m" to avoid file handling process and directly run the main file.
