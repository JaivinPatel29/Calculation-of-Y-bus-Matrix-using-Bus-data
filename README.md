# Calculation-of-Y-bus-Matrix-using-Bus-data
In this project, a slack bus, one PV and one PQ bus data's are used to compute bus admittance matrix (Y-Bus matrix) using MATLAB
The following transmission line data is used to compute the y_bus matrix : 
Bus number, capacitive admittance shunt, impedance (series)(r+jx)
Additionally, bus data such as angle, voltage magnitude, active and reactive power,etc. are provided to further use the data file for load flow analysis where ybus matrix will be applied such as gauss-seidel or newton-raphson algorithms.
